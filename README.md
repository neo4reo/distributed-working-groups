# DWG - Distributed Working Groups

This is a repo to organize thoughts around the concept of _Distributed (or Federated) Working Groups_. 
These are similar in style to the W3C and IETF working groups but smaller, more organic, and ad-hoc.
The products of a DWG would be protocols, tools, and proposals, which could then go on to the W3C and IETF.
